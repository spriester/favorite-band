      <p>The Salty Dogs are an imaginary band that I just made up 5 seconds ago. They feature Tommy Zigzag on lead guitar and vocals, Janice Scissorhands on rhythm guitar and backup vocals, Lily Buddha on keyboard, Jessica Messica on bass, and Adam Smadam on drums. They were formed in 2008 and released their first album, 'Doggy Daycare,' in January 2009.</p>
